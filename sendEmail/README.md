Send Email using PHPMailer



## Installation

Install composer and run the below command
```bash
 composer require phpmailer/phpmailer
```
Modifying the index.php file to include SMTP details and other relevant information for sending emails requires a few steps.

Open the index.php file: Locate and open the index.php file in your preferred code editor.

Import the necessary libraries: If your PHP project doesn't already have a library for sending emails, you may need to import one. Commonly used libraries include PHPMailer and SwiftMailer. Check if the library is already imported in your code. If not, download and include it in your project.

Set up SMTP details: Look for the section of code where the email sending process is initiated. You will need to specify your SMTP server details, including the host, port, username, and password.
